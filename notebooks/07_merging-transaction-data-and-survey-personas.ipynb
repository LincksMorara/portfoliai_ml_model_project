That model maps survey responses (answers, rankings, time-horizon, monitoring frequency, expected return, etc.) to a risk/persona output.\n","\n","The transaction_personas file (if present) is valuable because it contains transaction-based risk/persona signals (the outputs from Notebook 4–6).

If not: create survey_personas.csv (processed version) for notebook 7 to use.\n","\n","Important note about joining the datasets\n","\n","To merge survey records with transaction personas we need a common key (e.g., customerID, Username, email).
